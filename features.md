# Shopping List Web Application Features

## 1. User Management
-   **User Registration:** Allow new users to create an account (e.g., using a username and password).
-   **User Login:** Allow existing users to log in to their accounts.
-   **User Logout:** Allow users to log out.

## 2. Shopping List Management
-   **Create List:** Users can create new shopping lists with a name (e.g., "Weekly Groceries", "Hardware Store").
-   **View Lists:** Users can see all shopping lists they have created or that have been shared with them.
-   **Delete List:** Users can delete lists they own.
-   **Share List:**
    -   Users can share their shopping lists with other registered users in the family (e.g., by entering their username).
    -   Shared users will have collaborative access to the list (add/remove items).

## 3. Item Management (within a List)
-   **Add Item:** Users can add items to a shopping list. Each item should have a name (e.g., "Milk", "Eggs", "Bread").
-   **Mark Item as Purchased (Optional but Recommended):** Users can mark items as purchased (e.g., strikethrough or checkbox). This helps in tracking what's still needed.
-   **Delete Item:** Users can remove items from a shopping list.

## 4. Real-time Collaboration
-   **Live Updates:** When a user adds, deletes, or marks an item as purchased on a shared list, the changes are instantly reflected for all other users who currently have that list open. This is the core 'streaming' feature.

## 5. User Interface (UI) - General Ideas
-   **Dashboard/Homepage:** A main page displaying the user's shopping lists after login.
-   **List View:** A dedicated view for each shopping list, showing its items and controls to manage them.
-   **Intuitive Controls:** Easy-to-use buttons and forms for adding lists, items, and sharing.

## Backend Considerations
-   A backend server is required to handle user authentication, store list and item data, and manage real-time communication.

## Security Note
-   As per the request, security is not a primary concern for this small-scale family app. Basic password hashing should be implemented, but complex security measures can be omitted for simplicity.
